<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18">Artificial intelligence is a technology that is already impacting how users interact with, and are affected by the Internet. In the near future, its impact is likely to only continue to grow. AI has the potential to vastly change the way that humans interact, not only with the digital world, but also with each other, through their work and through other socioeconomic institutions – for better or for worse.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18">Artificial Intelligence : is a wide-ranging  branch of computer science that aims to imbue software with the ability to analyze its environment using either predetermined rules and search algorithms,or pattern recognizing machine learning models, and then make decisions based on those analyses.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18">Artificial intelligence is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. </p> 

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18">Artificial Intelligence is an ability to design smart machines or to develop self-learning software applications that imitate the traits of the human mind like reasoning, problem-solving,planning, optimal decision making, sensory perceptions etc.The capacity of artificial intelligent approaches to outperform human actions in terms of
knowledge discovery gained the attention of business and research communities all over the world and this field of study rapid progress in the past two decades.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18">Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20"><b>Types Of Learning In Artificial Intelligence :</b> </p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  1 - Artificial Narrow Intelligence</p>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  2- Artificial General Intelligence </p>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  3- Artificial Super Intelligence </p>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18">These are the three stages through which Artificial Intelligence can evolve, rather than the 3 types of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20"><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be categorized into four types:</b> </p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  1 - Reactive machines</p>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  2- Limited memory</p>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  3- Theory of mind </p>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:18"> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  4 - Self-awareness</p>
